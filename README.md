## Detailed Project Proposal Template

There is no particular format required for the proposal, other than that it must be submitted as a single document file.  

This repository contains a LaTeX version of the guide template included on page 23, Appendix A of the MSc Project Handbook.

Feel free to use this LaTeX template with [Overleaf](http://overleaf.com) or any other editor, e.g. [Microsoft Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) with the following extensions: LaTeX language support (mathematic.vscode-latex) and LaTeX Workshop (James-Yu.latex-workshop).

Manage references using a bibliography manager (see two examples below) which makes it easier to export bibtex entries.

## The essential things are:

  * It should be clear what the subject area is.
  * It should be clear what you intend to do; the more specific and detailed you are, the better.

## Sections you should include:

  * Project Title
  * Your MSc Project Course (Module Code and Title)
  * Your name and Student ID Number
  * Aims of the project
  * Research questions/ hypothesis
  * Objectives
  * Short description of your idea
  * Specify how you plan to conduct your research

It is also important that you cite the source of any background material that you have used or which would be helpful to us in 
understanding your proposal. Do not copy and paste material from any book, journal, website, or any other source you have referred to, 
simply cite that source.
